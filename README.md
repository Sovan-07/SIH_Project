# AABHAYA: Women Safety Analytics

## Project Overview
AABHAYA is a real-time women safety analytics system designed to create a safer environment for women through advanced surveillance and analytical solutions. The software monitors public spaces, detects potential threats, and generates alerts to help law enforcement intervene before incidents escalate. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision, AABHAYA aims to provide continuous monitoring and actionable insights for enhancing public safety.

## Key Features
1. **Person Detection with Gender Classification**: Detect individuals in real-time and classify their gender (male/female) using advanced models like VGG16 or YOLO.
   
2. **Gender Distribution Analysis**: Count the number of men and women present in specific locations at any given time, providing insights into the gender distribution.

3. **Identifying Lone Women at Night**: Detect situations where a woman is present alone in a public area during nighttime, potentially triggering an alert.

4. **Detection of Women Surrounded by Men**: Identify instances where a woman is surrounded by a large number of men, signaling a potential risk and triggering an alert.

5. **Gesture-Based SOS Detection**: Recognize SOS gestures that women may use in distress, and generate an immediate alert for rapid response.



## System Advantages
- **Real-time monitoring**: Helps ensure a safer environment for women by actively monitoring public spaces and generating timely alerts.
- **Proactive detection**: Early identification of suspicious patterns allows law enforcement to intervene before situations escalate.
- **Data-driven insights**: Continuous analysis of gender distribution and threat detection helps in identifying hotspots and guiding strategic planning for public safety.
